--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CTF NAME : Forthare Bank
Category : Web
Description : Welcome to Forthare Bank Heist! You stand outside the towering walls of Forthare Bank, 
planning your heist to steal the gold deposit inside. The security appears tight,
 but every system has its weaknesses...

Target : Accessing the "Vault Area"
Goal : Building The Hacker Mindset.

Methodology & Attacker Mindset

This challenge was approached as a mindset-driven security simulation rather than a technical exploitation lab.
The objective was to think like an attacker who relies on observation, logic and human weaknesses instead
of scanners or exploits.

1- Environmental Awareness Before Action

Instead of rushing into commands, I first analyzed the surroundings, movement paths, and security coverage.
Identifying a camera blind spot demonstrated how physical and logical security often fail at the edges,
not the center.

2- Human Behavior as an Attack Surface

The keypad code was not cracked through brute force but discovered through behavioral clues  worn buttons 
and a hidden note. This reflects a real-world principle:

People are often the weakest link, and convenience leaves traces.

3- Low-Risk Enumeration Strategy

Rather than moving directly toward high-security areas, I prioritized low-monitoring zones (like the break room)
to safely gather context. This mirrors real engagements where attackers avoid detection spikes by expanding 
knowledge gradually.

4- Information Over Exploitation

Every step focused on collecting intelligence before acting — mapping locations, identifying guard presence,
and spotting assets of interest (like access cards on security monitors). This reinforces that good attackers 
build a mental model before taking risks.

5- Controlled Risk Escalation

When entering monitored areas, the decision was intentional and based on prior reconnaissance. 
The increasing detection level simulated real-world trade-offs between speed and stealth.



Lessons Learned :

--------------------------------------- Thinking beats tools -------------------------------------------------------
Real impact in cybersecurity comes from understanding why something works, not just running scripts or frameworks.

Methodology > Random Actions
Following a structured approach (like profiling behavior, identifying trust triggers, and mapping influence paths)
is far more effective than unplanned testing.

------------------------------------ Human factors are attack surfaces ----------------------------------------------
Technical defenses are strong, but psychology, authority, urgency, and trust are often the real entry points.

----------------------------------Authority is about perception, not power ------------------------------------------
People respond to perceived expertise and hierarchy, even when the authority is only implied.

--------------------------------------- Small details create big leverage -------------------------------------------
Job titles, tone of communication, branding, and context can drastically change how a target reacts.

-------------------------------- Ethical boundaries shape professional skill ----------------------------------------
Understanding these techniques in a controlled, ethical context builds defensive awareness, not exploitation habits.

-------------------------- Documenting the thought process is as important as results -------------------------------
Clear reasoning, assumptions, and decision paths show maturity in cybersecurity more than just a successful outcome.
